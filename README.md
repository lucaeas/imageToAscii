Image to Ascii - Converter
=======

## About this project
This is a small GUI that converts a file of your choice in a .txt file that will be created in the folder of your image after conversion. This text can be copied directly from the window. I made this project in a single afternoon so it is not polished and is solely conceived to be practical.

---

## How to use it
Once you have downloaded the file, open your cmd, go into the folder in which you installed the converter and type this command:
```
C:/imageToAscii> python -u main.py
```

Normally, a graphical interface should appear. There you have three options:
* Browse - Search for the image to convert
* Convert - Convert the image
* Copy - Copy the ASCII of the converted image

Now you know how to use this basic converter, do not hesitate to contact me if there is any issue!
